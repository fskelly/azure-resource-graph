# Azure Resource Graph Queries
A collection on Azure Resource Graph Queries that I use fairly regularly. Working to have the queries listed in different folders in an attempt to make them easier to find.

These queries are designed to be run in [Azure Resource Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) and **NOT** in Azure Monitor, so some the functionality would be different. Not all aspects of the query language work in Azure Resource Graph.
